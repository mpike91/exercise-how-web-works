- HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a procedural standard by which HTML requests are sent and received.
- URL is Uniform Resource Locator. It is a unique address of a resource on the internet.
- DNS is Domain Name System. It is like the internet's phonebook of hostnames and their corresponding IP Addresses.
- Query String is a string of form inputs passed as part of a GET request to the server.
- GET and POST. GET is used to make server requests without modifying any server-side data. POST is used to make
changes to server-side data.
- HTTP request is when someone, through a browser, is seeking to pull up a website from a server by "requesting" 
access to the server information.
- HTTP response is the server's response to a browser's request, and it returns HTML and related files that the 
browser can render into a website.
- HTTP header is a set of basic data in a request or response. Request and response headers would include the date
and time of the request / response. Requests include the hostname they're asking about, often the language the 
browser wants information in. Responses include content type (text/html for web pages), cookies, caching info, etc.
- An http request is sent, a DNS turns somesite.com into an IP address, the default port of 80 is chosen since
none is specified, then /some/page.html is pulled from the web server and the page renders in the browser.
